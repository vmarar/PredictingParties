Predicting Political Parties Using Twitter Data 

This was a project that used a dataset of tweets from politcal figures both Democratic and Republican. The goal was to use different machine learning algorithims alongside CountVectorizer and TF-IDF to predict whether a tweet is Democratic or Republican. 

This was a final project for one of my classes , attached above are the report and presentation for the project as well. Thanks for reading!
